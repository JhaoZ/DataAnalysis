# DataAnalysis
My data analysis project for AP Computer Science P.

To use this project, you need to import all the java files and download JFreeChart jar at https://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/download/. 

Download version 1.0.1, the zip file if you are using windows and the gz file if you are using linux.
Import the jars into the IDE, you only need to import two.

This two jars are in the lib folder, and even though there are 5 jars, you only need to import jfreechart-1.0.1.jar and jcommon-1.0.0.jar. 

Use eclipse to import the java files and the two jars, you can use build path to add the jars (right click on the project).

After importing it, you have to open Anaylsis.java, which is where to run the main code. You also need the csv file.
It will run and post several questions on whether you want to view the charts and graphs, if you want to, input the character "Y".
